## Lab: A1 - HMM

A lab in the course Artificial Intelligence - DD2380. In the lab it was required to understand and implement different HMM problems. The solutions to the different problems were implemented in Java.

##### HMM0

Given the parameter set λ = (A,B,π) and that we have observed the realization O1:T = o1:T, we want to predict the next observation.

##### HMM1

Given the model λ = (A, B, π) and a sequence of observations O, find P (O | λ). We want to determine the likelihood of the observed sequence O, given the model.

##### HMM2

Given λ = (A, B, π) and an observation sequence O, we want to find an optimal state sequence for the underlying Markov process.

##### HMM3

Given an observation sequence O and the dimensions N and M, we want to find the model λ = (A,B,π) that maximizes the probability of O. This can be viewed as training a model to best fit the observed data.

## Lab: A2 - Tic-Tac-Toe

A lab in the course Artificial Intelligence - DD2380. In the lab an skeleton code was given, in this code we then added an implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to speed it up.
This to be able to write a program computing the best possible next move for player X in a game of tic-tac-toe, given a particular state of the game for n = 2. 

Due to time constraints, we could not analyse the complete game tree. Therefore, we investigate the influence of the maximum search depth and come up with a suitable evaluation function.
